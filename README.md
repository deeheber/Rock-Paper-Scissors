# golang-rock-paper-scissors

Rock paper scissors command line game written in golang

## TODO
- Add in colors for command line feedback (red for lose and green for win)
- Final pass...might possibly want to tweak console output messaging

## How to run
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the `golang-rock-paper-scissors` directory
2. `go install` to install the included packages
3. `go get -u github.com/AlecAivazis/survey` to install the vendor package
4. `go run main.go` to compile and start the game
